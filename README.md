# Trident G Loop Theory

This repository documents the **Trident G Loop Theory**, an integrative framework for understanding general intelligence (g) as a dynamic, self-organising process.  
It combines insights from cognitive neuroscience, criticality theory, reinforcement learning, and active inference.

## 🌊 Core Idea

The **Trident G Loop** proposes that intelligence emerges from a continuous loop linking:

- **Creative mode (exploration, divergent thinking, D2-dominant)**
- **Control mode (rule application, executive compression, D1-dominant)**
- **Autopilot mode (habitual/automatic, crystallised knowledge)**

These modes interact within a **near-critical band of brain dynamics**, regulated by salience systems and dopaminergic gating.  
The “loop” keeps cognition flexible, adaptive, and tuned to goals in uncertain environments.

## 🔑 Key Principles
- **Criticality band:** Brains operate not at a knife-edge, but across a Griffiths-phase-like band that balances stability and flexibility.  
- **Constraint–check loop:** Cognition cycles through expansion (creative decompression) and compression (executive control), with autopilot consolidating stable patterns.  
- **Salience regulation:** The salience network and dopamine balance (D1:D2) act as gatekeepers, switching between modes.  
- **Fluid–crystallised integration:** General intelligence (g) reflects coordination between fluid exploration and crystallised knowledge across time.
- **Gf × r principle:** *General adaptive intelligence (G) = fluid intelligence (Gf) × cognitive resilience (r).*  
  - **Gf** supplies the capacity for novel problem-solving and representational flexibility.  
  - **Resilience (r)** supplies stability, error tolerance, and recovery under uncertainty or stress.  
  - The multiplicative relation emphasises that **high G requires both flexibility and resilience**, ensuring robust adaptation in complex environments.  
- **Translational scope:** The framework links neural mechanisms, behavioural intelligence, training methods, and societal scaling.

## 🧩 Example Research Questions
- How does dopamine tone (D1 vs D2) regulate transitions between creative and control modes?  
- Can dual n-back + strategy training shift mode balance to optimise g and G?  
- How does the salience network link to fluid intelligence in functional connectivity studies?  
- Can near-criticality models (e.g. Wilson–Cowan simulations) reproduce the loop dynamics?
